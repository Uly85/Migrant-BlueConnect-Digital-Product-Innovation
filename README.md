Digital Product Innovation: Migrant Blue Connect

Providing the millions of blue collar workers that seek employment abroad with access to both necessary resources 
to gain employment and an easily accessible platform to connect them with employers that provide 
safe working conditions , fair pay, and equitable treatment standards. We believe providing one stop access to safe job placement resources 
for historically vulnerable populations of migrant workers will achieve the aim of providing safe and ethical working conditions.

In doing this project we collaborate as a team including activities:
- Digital Product Startup Idea Generation
- Customer Interviews
- De-risk and pivot our Business idea
- Customer Persona and Journey Map
- Prototype and Test
- Increase fidelity of your prototype and test again
- Integrate demo into pitch, prepare a financial model, complete your pitch presentation
